# grant — the toggle stayed on in System Settings while the permission silently
# stopped working. Signing with the shared certificate gives Debug and Release
# an identical DR, so one grant covers both and survives every rebuild.
#
# This is best-effort locally: without the certificate the script falls back to
# ad-hoc (with a warning) so the dev loop still works. Run
# scripts/make-signing-cert.sh once to stop the permission drops.

# not mean this pattern missed the process. Verify with `pgrep -fl` if needed.

# The app resolves and spawns the coding CLIs (`claude`, `codex`, `cmd`) to read
# their sign-in state — and a child process inherits whatever the app was
# launched with. A reinstall run from an agent/automation session hands its own
# environment over (`open` forwards the caller's env; the nohup fallback
# inherits it outright), so the app would probe with CLAUDECODE=1,
# ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL and a session's OAuth/token vars in scope — and the CLIs
# answer as a nested session instead of the user's own login. On screen that
# reads as "signed out" with nothing actually wrong on disk.
#
# A Finder/Dock launch carries none of that; `env -i` reproduces exactly that
# starting point (the app finds the CLIs through a login shell anyway, so the
# bare PATH costs it nothing).
