# NotchFlow — the single code-signing implementation. CI (release.yml) and the local
# dev loop (reinstall.sh) both call this, so the shipped bundle and the locally
# installed one can never drift apart in signing identity, entitlements, or
# hardened-runtime state.

#
# Why this exists at all: macOS TCC (the privacy database behind the
# Accessibility grant) does not remember "this app". It stores the app's
# *designated requirement* and re-evaluates it on every launch. An ad-hoc
# signature's DR is a bare `cdhash H"..."` — the hash of one exact binary — so
# every rebuild and every release produces a requirement the stored grant no
# longer satisfies, and the Accessibility permission silently stops working
# (the toggle still *looks* enabled in System Settings, which is what makes it
# so confusing). Signing with a real certificate makes the DR
# `identifier "..." and certificate leaf H"..."`, which is stable across builds
# forever. See scripts/make-signing-cert.sh for creating that certificate.
#
# Environment:
#   NOTCHFLOW_SIGN_IDENTITY  identity to sign with (default: "NotchFlow Code Signing")
#   NOTCHFLOW_SIGN_KEYCHAIN  keychain to search for it (default: the search list)
#   NOTCHFLOW_SIGN_REQUIRED  1 ⇒ hard-fail when the identity is missing, instead of
#                         falling back to ad-hoc. CI sets this; the local dev
#                         loop does not, so reinstall.sh keeps working on a
#                         machine that has not created the certificate yet.
#   NOTCHFLOW_REQUIRE_DEVELOPER_ID  1 ⇒ require a Developer ID Application
#                         identity. The direct-download release job sets this.

# the old release step re-signed without the flag, silently dropping it together
# with the entitlements. Release is safe: a single Mach-O, no third-party
# libraries, no microphone/camera APIs.
#
# It is NOT applied to Debug, because the hardened runtime turns on *library
# validation* and Xcode injects two of its own dylibs into a Debug bundle
# (NotchFlow.debug.dylib for the incremental-build stub, __preview.dylib for
# SwiftUI previews). Re-signing the bundle leaves those with a different signing
# identity than the main executable, and dyld then refuses to map them:
#
#   Library not loaded: @rpath/NotchFlow.debug.dylib
#   Reason: ... mapping process and mapped file (non-platform) have different
#           Team IDs
#
# — i.e. the app builds, signs, verifies, installs, and then will not start.
# This is also why Xcode's own "Sign to Run Locally" leaves Debug builds without
# the runtime flag. Entitlements do not affect the designated requirement, and
# neither does this, so Debug and Release still share one TCC grant.
