/// notification reopens that exact conversation in the panel.
///
/// Why this exists: the whole point of Notch is "ask and walk away." When the
/// answer lands and you're no longer looking at the panel, there's otherwise no
/// signal it's ready — the dots just quietly go out. A native banner closes that
/// loop without the app having to steal focus or pop a window on its own.
///
/// Scope is deliberately narrow: it ONLY fires for the detached case. If the
/// panel is still on screen showing the answer stream, the user is already
/// watching — no notification. (The trigger lives in `NotchModel.submit`, gated
/// on `!isOnScreen`.)
