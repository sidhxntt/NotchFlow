/// A model backend that shells out to the user's locally-installed **Claude Code
/// CLI** (`claude -p --output-format stream-json`) and streams the answer back —
/// the Claude twin of `CodexCLIService`.
///
/// **Compliance posture (deliberate, load-bearing — do not loosen):** Anthropic's
/// enforcement line distinguishes spawning the *genuine* `claude` binary under
/// the user's own sign-in (permitted; how every CLI-wrapper app operates) from
/// extracting OAuth tokens and impersonating Claude Code against the API
/// (banned). Notch stays squarely on the permitted side:
///  · only the official binary is ever executed — Notch speaks no HTTP to
///    Anthropic and never reads `~/.claude/.credentials.json` or the Keychain;
///  · sign-in detection is an existence check on the `oauthAccount` *metadata*
///    marker in `~/.claude.json` — never a token;
///  · there is NO in-app "sign in to Claude" flow (unlike Codex's re-authorize):
///    the user signs in in their own terminal by running `claude`. Usage bills
///    to their own Claude plan.
///
/// Shape of the integration (mirrors Codex):
///  · one turn = one `claude -p` process; the running conversation is folded
///    into a single stdin prompt, the persona rides `--system-prompt`.
///  · `--safe-mode` isolates the turn from the user's customizations (CLAUDE.md,
///    plugins, MCP servers, hooks) — the Codex `--ignore-user-config` analog.
///    Verified locally: without it, a loaded setup adds ~10k tokens of context
///    to every turn.
///  · `--no-session-persistence` keeps quick chats out of `~/.claude` session
///    history (the agent path is the opposite: it persists for `--resume`).
///  · `--tools WebSearch WebFetch` leaves exactly the web tools available, so a
///    time-sensitive question can be searched — everything else (file access,
///    bash) is off for a chat turn.
///  · `--output-format stream-json` (requires `--verbose`) prints JSONL; answer
///    text arrives as complete `assistant` message events (whole blocks, not
///    token deltas), and the final `result` event carries success/failure.
