/// **Threading — why this runs OFF the main thread.** `executeAppleEvent` blocks
/// the calling thread until the script returns. On the *first* write, macOS shows
/// the TCC "wants access to control Notes" prompt — a modal that needs the **main
/// runloop** to handle the user's click. If we block the main thread inside
/// `executeAppleEvent`, the prompt can paint but never receives the click: the
/// main thread waits on the script, the script waits on the user, the user's
/// click waits on the main thread → the whole app deadlocks (the freeze seen when
/// the permission dialog appeared). So the script runs on a dedicated **serial**
/// background queue, leaving the main runloop free to drive the prompt. The

/// created on, and only ever touched from, that one serial queue — never shared
