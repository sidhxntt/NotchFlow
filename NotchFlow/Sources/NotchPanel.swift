///  · no title bar / no shadow drawn by AppKit (the glass draws its own)
///  · transparent background so only the SwiftUI glass form is visible
///  · floats above every app and joins every Space / full-screen app
///  · non-activating as a *style*, so a stray click on the glass never activates
///    the app by itself (it can still receive key events via `canBecomeKey`).
///    App activation is driven deliberately by the AppDelegate open/close path
///    instead — the panel must belong to the *focused application* while open,
///    or AX-based voice/dictation tools (Typeless & co.) can't reach its fields.
