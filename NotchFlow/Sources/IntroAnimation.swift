/// The first-run intro — the app's whole onboarding, and the only one.
///
/// The screen dims to a veil of black — not a blackout; the desktop stays faintly
/// there behind it — and the NotchFlow mark swings in dead center, already a solid of
/// glass. It idles there, turning slowly so the light travels across its bevels,
/// then spins once, fast, the way the Dynamic Island flips a transit card —
/// shrinking and rising as it turns — and tucks into the notch. The panel opens on
/// the chat prompt the instant it lands.
///
/// The mark is only the glyph — the flag and its dot, the shapes from the middle
/// of the app icon, lifted out and given depth. No plate, no rounded square: what
/// flies is the mark itself.
///
/// Built in SceneKit because the "3D" has to be real: extruded geometry with
/// chamfered edges, plus a fragment shader that refracts an environment through
/// the solid (see `glassShader`) — SceneKit's own transparency is a flat alpha
/// blend and reads as tinted plastic. A faked pseudo-3D (layer transforms on a
/// PNG) falls apart at exactly the moment this animation is about — the turn.
///
/// Every value is written per frame from our own clock rather than handed to
/// SceneKit as an implicit animation. In a borderless overlay window SceneKit's
/// animation clock never advances (the symptom: a scene frozen on frame zero —
/// model values set, presentation values never moving) and the view's own display
/// link never fires, so a plain run-loop timer drives it and `sceneTime` is what
/// pushes each redraw. It also makes the whole run a pure function of elapsed
/// time, so a skip can cut in anywhere.
///
/// Plays once ever, on a fresh install (see `OnboardingService`). Esc or a click
/// skips straight to the panel; reduce-motion skips it entirely.
