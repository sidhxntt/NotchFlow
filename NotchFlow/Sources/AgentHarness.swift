// MARK: - Agent turn protocol
//
// The single-shot `AIService.stream(system:messages:)` answers a question in one
// pass: text in, text out. An *agent* turn is richer — the model may decide to
// call a tool, the harness runs it, feeds the result back, and the model
// continues, possibly for several rounds, until it has nothing left to do. That
// loop needs more than a `String` stream: it needs to see, per turn, the text the
// model wrote, any tool calls it requested, and why it stopped.
//
// `TurnEvent` is that richer stream. `AIService.streamTurn` yields these events
// for one model turn; `AgentHarness` runs the multi-turn loop on top. The old
// `stream(system:messages:)` stays exactly as it was — every non-agent path
// (title generation, the `complete` convenience, any provider that can't or
// won't do tools) keeps using it untouched. Tool support is purely additive.

/// One incremental event from a single agent turn.
