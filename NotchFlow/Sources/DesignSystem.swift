/// dissolving *behind* the floating input header — while the un-blurred original
/// shows through below. (An earlier version stacked four blurred copies for a
/// stepped ramp; that rebuilt the whole up-to-50-row list four times per edge on
/// every open and was the multi-second click-to-expand stall. The gradient mask
/// already carries the ramp, so the single flattened copy reads the same.)
