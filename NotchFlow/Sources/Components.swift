///   size compensation, tuned around a 300pt frame).
/// - `engine/ribbon.ts` → `drawRibbon` (the demo's "Thinking…." pill),
///   `engine/lattice.ts` → `drawGlobe` (searching — a scan meridian sweeps a
///   dotted globe) and `drawRubik` (solving — the same dot field cut into

///   orbits), and `engine/web.ts` → `drawWeb` (connecting — a drifting
///   constellation whose nodes wire together and pass bright packets). All
///   verbatim.
/// - `engine/profiles.ts` + `presets.ts` → each mode's base profile with its
///   inline `@ size 20` preset applied through the same `scaleCounts` /
///   `scaleRadii` machinery. The reference's remaining modes (wave / braid /

/// The first attempt at "writing" swept a nib left to right across the whole

/// left-to-right movement — and wrong for Chinese, where 你 is written 亻 then
/// 尔 and no part of that is a horizontal sweep. This renderer keeps the sweep
/// for the scripts it suits and hands every character with stroke data over to
/// `StrokeInk`.
///
/// # Why Chinese is drawn even when it isn't moving
///
/// A character mid-write is `StrokeInk`'s marker ink; if a finished character
/// reverted to the font's glyph it would visibly pop the instant it completed.
/// So in handwriting mode the ink *is* the typeface for Chinese — settled text
/// included — and the renderer runs on every handwritten line, not only the
