/// A model backend that shells out to the user's locally-installed **Codex CLI**
/// (`codex exec --json`) and streams its answer back.
///
/// Unlike every other `Provider`, Codex carries no API key: it reuses the ChatGPT
/// sign-in the user already did with `codex login` (the OAuth tokens cached in
/// `~/.codex/auth.json`), so usage is billed against their ChatGPT plan, not an API
/// account. That's the whole point — a keyless "use the ChatGPT I already pay for"
/// backend.
///
/// Why a subprocess and not an HTTP client: the ChatGPT-subscription path talks to a
/// private backend (`chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex`) behind an undocumented,
/// client-attested handshake (a whitelisted `originator`, exact headers, a fixed
/// instructions preamble). Rather than reimplement and impersonate that, we let the
/// official `codex` binary do it — the documented, supported headless interface.
///
/// Shape of the integration:
///  · one turn = one `codex exec` process. The persona (`system`) and the running
///    conversation are folded into a single prompt fed on stdin.
///  · `--json` prints JSONL events; the agent's answer arrives as a single
///    `item.completed` event with `item.type == "agent_message"` (the whole text,
///    not token deltas), so this stream yields once.
///  · `--ignore-user-config` isolates Notch from the user's global codex config
///    (skills / MCP / model / reasoning-effort) for a fast, predictable answer;
///    `-s read-only` plus an ephemeral temp working directory keep it from touching
///    the filesystem, and `--skip-git-repo-check` lets it run outside a repo.
///
/// Codex runs its own agent loop (web search, reasoning) internally, so this conforms
/// to `AIService` only — it deliberately does NOT adopt `AgentCapableService`, so
/// Notch's own tool harness stays out of its way (the turn dispatcher falls back to
/// the plain `stream` path for a non-agent service).
///
/// Known v1 limitation: pasted images (`ChatMessage.images`) are not forwarded — Codex
/// is text-only here. The picker's Codex row uses the id "codex", which reads as
/// non-vision, so no image thumbnail is offered for it in the first place.
