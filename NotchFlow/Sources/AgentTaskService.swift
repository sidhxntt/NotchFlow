///     Code updates itself in the background, so no table we ship or serve can
///     know which build a given user is on.
///  2. **The remote manifest** (`RemoteModelManifest.efforts`) — the maintained
///     table on the website, so a CLI release that moves a model's set is fixed
///     without shipping an app update. It can also be told to *outrank* the probe
///     per engine (`effortsOverride`), which is the lever for a probe that has
///     started misreading the binary — off by default, since a probe that simply
///     fails already falls through to here.
///  3. **The bundled table below** — the same measurement baked in, so a fresh
///     offline install is already right.
///
/// That order is the one this app already uses for models: the vendor's own live
/// catalog supersedes the manifest, which supersedes the bundled spec
/// (`RemoteModelManifest`). The probe is the live catalog of this seam.
///
/// A model no layer knows offers **no rungs at all** (Default only, no `--effort`
/// sent). That is deliberate: sending an unverified level risks the run, and the
/// upside is one menu entry. The probe fills the menu in a second or so.

/// This is deliberately a different animal from `CodexCLIService` (the chat

///  · **write access** — the chat runs `-s read-only` in a throwaway temp dir; a
///    agent task runs `-s workspace-write -C <folder>` so Codex can actually

///    sandbox — codex's own workspace-write default — so an unattended task can't
///    reach out; it can still read/write every file under the folder.)
///  · **lifetime** — a chat turn is seconds and dies with the panel; an agent
///    task is minutes and must survive the panel closing, so the process is owned
///    by this singleton, not by a view's stream. Closing the notch never cancels
///    it — and neither does quitting the app: the CLI's output goes to a file,
///    not a pipe, so the run keeps working unattended and the next launch
///    re-attaches to it (`recoverInterruptedRuns`).
///  · **user config** — the chat isolates itself (`--ignore-user-config`) for a
///    fast predictable answer; an agent task *honors* the user's own codex
///    setup (model, reasoning effort, skills), because capability matters more
///    than latency here. The session is also persisted (no `--ephemeral`), so the
///    user can pick the run up later with `codex resume` in a terminal.
///
/// Tasks run in parallel — submitting while others are working just spawns
/// another process (same folder included, by explicit decision: the CLIs cope
/// the way they do in a terminal). Each run owns its own process, parser and
/// teardown; nothing is shared between runs. Progress (the current command /
/// file edit) streams into its task's `activity` for the in-panel card;
