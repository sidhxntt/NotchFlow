/// A model backend that shells out to the user's locally-installed **Command Code
/// CLI** (`cmd -p --output-format json`) and streams its answer back — the
/// commandcode.ai twin of `CodexCLIService` / `ClaudeCLIService` / `GrokCLIService`.
///
/// Like the other three, Command Code carries **no API key of ours**: it reuses the
/// sign-in the user already did (`cmd login` → browser OAuth, key cached in
/// `~/.commandcode/auth.json`), or the `COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY` env var if they set
/// one. Usage bills against the user's own Command Code plan — the whole point of a
/// "use the CLI I already pay for" backend.
///
/// What makes it different from its three siblings: Command Code is an **aggregator**
/// (one account fronts ~50 models across Anthropic / OpenAI / Google / xAI / Qwen /
/// Kimi / GLM / DeepSeek / …), so its model list is the interesting surface, not a
/// single vendor's lineup. That list comes from the CLI itself — `cmd --list-models`
/// prints the catalog the installed build actually accepts — never a table bundled
/// here that would rot the day they ship a model.
///
/// **Compliance posture (mirrors the other CLI backends):** only the official binary
/// is ever executed. Notch speaks no HTTP to commandcode.ai, never reads the key in
/// `~/.commandcode/auth.json` (sign-in detection is a presence check on the file's
/// `apiKey` marker, never its value), and offers **no in-app sign-in**: `cmd login`
/// renders an interactive terminal UI (an ink app reading a real TTY), so unlike
/// `grok login` it cannot be driven headlessly — the account row tells the user to
/// run it in their own terminal, exactly like the Claude Code row.
///
/// Shape of the integration (mirrors the twins):
///  · one turn = one `cmd -p` process; the running conversation is folded into a
///    single stdin prompt. There is no `--system-prompt` flag, so the persona rides
///    at the head of that prompt (`CodexCLIService.composePrompt`, the Codex shape).
///  · `--output-format json` prints NDJSON: `{"type":"event","event":{…}}` frames —
///    including token-level `text_delta` deltas, so this stream yields as it types —
///    and one terminal `{"type":"result",…}` line carrying `subtype` / `finalText`.
///  · headless mode already denies file writes and shell commands by default; an
///    explicit `--permission-mode standard` keeps that true whatever the user's
///    `settings.json` says, so a chat turn keeps exactly the read-only tools
///    (including `web_search` / `web_fetch`, which is how a time-sensitive question
///    gets answered). `--no-skills` and an ephemeral `cwd` isolate the turn from the
///    user's skills / AGENTS.md / project config; `--no-session` keeps quick chats
///    out of their session history; `--trust` and `--skip-onboarding` stop it
///    blocking on a prompt no one is there to answer.
///
/// Command Code runs its own agent loop (search, reasoning, tools) internally, so
/// this conforms to `AIService` only — like the twins it deliberately does NOT adopt
/// the tool harness, so Notch's tools stay out of its way.
