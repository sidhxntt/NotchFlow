/// Notch is a GUI app, so it inherits **launchd's** environment — `PATH` is
/// `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin` and nothing else. Everything the
/// user's shell config builds is missing, which breaks CLI support twice over:
///
///  1. **Finding the binary.** A CLI installed by a node version manager (nvm /
///     fnm / volta / hermes) lives in that manager's bin dir, which is on no fixed
///     list and not in launchd's PATH.
///  2. **Running it.** Most of these CLIs are `#!/usr/bin/env node` scripts, so the
///     shebang re-runs a PATH lookup at exec time — and under a version manager the
///     only `node` on the machine sits in that same bin dir. Without it the spawn
///     dies with `env: node: No such file or directory`, which reads to the user as
///     "not installed" even though the CLI works fine in their terminal.
///
/// The shell is asked with **`-ilc` — interactive *and* login**, and that is the
/// whole trick. zsh sources `.zprofile` for login shells but `.zshrc` only for
/// *interactive* ones, and `.zshrc` is where `export PATH=…` actually lands for
/// most people. A plain `-lc` probe (what this code used to do) reports a PATH the
/// user has never seen, missing exactly the dir the CLI is installed in.
///
/// This is the child-process twin of `ProxyConfig`, which solves the same
/// "launchd's environment isn't the user's" problem for proxy variables.
