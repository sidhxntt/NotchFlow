/// approach `VendorLogos` takes, one file over.
///
/// Lucide rather than SF Symbols for one measurable reason: **stroke weight**. SF's
/// glyphs carry System-Settings optical mass, and Lucide's own 2px default (authored on
/// a 24-unit grid) lands at 1.08pt when drawn at 13pt — half again heavier than the
/// hairlines this app is built from (the manage card's own rim is 0.75pt, and most other
/// borders are 0.5pt). Because Lucide is *stroked*, its weight is a free parameter:
/// `weight` below is in the source's 24-unit grid, so 1.75 renders at 13 × 1.75 ÷ 24 =
/// 0.95pt — inside the app's line language instead of shouting over it.
