/// A model backend that shells out to the user's locally-installed **pi** CLI
/// (`pi -p --mode json`) and streams its answer back — the fifth of the same family
/// as `CodexCLIService` / `ClaudeCLIService` / `GrokCLIService` /
/// `CommandCodeCLIService`.
///
/// Like the other four, pi carries **no API key of ours**: it reuses whatever the
/// user already signed in with (`/login` inside pi's own TUI → OAuth tokens in
/// `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`, or any of the ~40 provider API-key env vars pi reads).
/// Usage bills against the user's own accounts — the whole point of a "use the CLI I
/// already pay for" backend.
///
/// What makes it different from its four siblings: pi is a **multi-account
/// aggregator**. Command Code fronts ~50 models under ONE account; pi fronts every
/// provider the user has separately signed into — a ChatGPT subscription, a Claude
/// Pro plan, a Command Code account, an xAI key — side by side in a single catalog.
/// So a pi model is only fully named by the pair *(provider, model)*: this Mac's
/// catalog carries `gpt-5.4` twice, once under `commandcode` and once under
/// `openai-codex`. The ids this service hands the rest of the app are therefore
/// `"<pi-provider>/<model-id>"`, split back apart into `--provider` / `--model` at
/// spawn time (see `spawnArgs`).
///
/// **Compliance posture (mirrors the other CLI backends):** only the official binary
/// is ever executed. Notch speaks no HTTP to any pi provider, never reads the tokens
/// in `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`, and offers **no in-app sign-in**: pi's `/login` is a
/// slash command inside its interactive TUI (an ink app reading a real TTY), so like
/// Claude Code and Command Code — and unlike `grok login` — it cannot be driven
/// headlessly. The account row tells the user to run `pi` in their own terminal.
///
/// Shape of the integration (mirrors the twins):
///  · one turn = one `pi -p` process; the running conversation is folded into a
///    single stdin prompt. The persona rides `--system-prompt` (pi's documented
///    flag), so the prompt carries only the folded conversation.
///  · `--mode json` prints NDJSON: a `{"type":"session",…}` header, then
///    `{"type":"message_update","assistantMessageEvent":{"type":"text_delta",…}}`
///    answer deltas (token-level, so this stream yields as it types), interleaved
///    `thinking_delta` reasoning we drop, and `{"type":"message_end",…}` frames
///    carrying the turn's real usage. See pi's own `docs/json.md`.
///  · a chat turn runs with **no tools at all** (`-nt`). pi's built-ins are
///    `read`/`write`/`edit`/`bash`/`ls`/`grep`/`find` — a filesystem/shell set with
///    no web search in it, so none of it can help answer a chat question and all of
///    it would run unattended. `--no-extensions` / `--no-skills` /
///    `--no-context-files` / `--no-prompt-templates` / `--no-themes` /
///    `--no-approve` plus an ephemeral cwd keep the turn out of the user's own pi
///    configuration, and `--no-session` keeps quick chats out of their history.
///
/// pi runs its own agent loop internally, so this conforms to `AIService` only —
/// like the twins it deliberately does NOT adopt the tool harness. Note that pi is
/// the one CLI backend with **no web search of any kind** (see
/// `Provider.supportsWebSearch`), so a pi chat answers from training data alone.
