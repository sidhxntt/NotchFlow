    whatever text is selected in any app. Value is the chord, or remove to delete a binding, \
    or keep to edit only its text. `prompt` carries the instruction and is required when \
    creating one. `scope` picks an existing binding by its current chord (option+s) or by a \
    distinctive part of its prompt; omit scope to create a new binding.
    - custom_instructions: text (empty clears it); proxy: URL/host, or auto to clear the manual proxy
    - ai_provider: openrouter, vercel, openai, codex, claude_code, grok_code, pi_code, anthropic, gemini, deepseek, qwen, glm, kimi, minimax, mimo, custom
    - ai_model: model id or default; optional scope is a provider (defaults to the active provider)
    - api_key: key text or empty to remove; scope is the provider (defaults to active). Never read keys back.
    - search_backend: native, keenable, exa, or anysearch
    - search_api_key: key text or empty to remove; scope must be keenable, exa, or anysearch. Never read keys back.
    - custom_provider_name / custom_provider_url / custom_provider_model: text (empty clears it)

    action=list returns every current value (keys only report configured/not configured). \
    action=shortcuts returns the complete localized keyboard-shortcut reference, including \
    the user's current summon shortcut, every editable action with its scope id, and the \
    user's prompt shortcuts. Use it whenever the user asks what shortcuts, hotkeys, or key \
    commands the app supports, and ALWAYS read it before changing action_shortcut or \
    prompt_shortcut so the scope you send points at a binding that really exists. \
    action=open opens the relevant in-app Settings page without changing anything; \
    section must be model, capture, general, appearance, shortcuts, stats, or about. Use open \
    when the user asks for an unsupported value (for example an interface language \
    the app does not offer), so they land on the real available choices instead of \
    receiving only a textual refusal. Opening a page needs no confirmation. \
    For action=update, `changes` is required. Each change has setting, value, and \
    optional scope. Use canonical values above even when the user speaks another language.
