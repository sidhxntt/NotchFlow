/// black, the mark appears as a real 3D object, turns once and flies into the
/// notch, and the panel opens on the chat prompt (see `IntroAnimation`). No
/// steps, no cards, no "connect a model" wizard — the app introduces itself by
/// showing you where it lives, then gets out of the way.

/// resolved at launch, flipped once the intro has played. First-run and What's
/// New stay independent (cold install vs. update) but cooperate at one seam: a
/// brand-new install must not stack the What's New panel on top of the intro (see
/// `WhatsNewService`'s "first-ever launch stays quiet" rule, which already
/// suppresses it).
