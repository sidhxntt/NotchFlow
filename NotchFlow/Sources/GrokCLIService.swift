/// A model backend that shells out to the user's locally-installed **Grok CLI**
/// (xAI's `grok`, "Grok Build") and streams its answer back — the xAI twin of
/// `CodexCLIService` / `ClaudeCLIService`.
///
/// Like Codex and Claude Code, Grok carries **no API key of ours**: it reuses the
/// sign-in the user already did (`grok login` → browser OAuth against `auth.x.ai`,
/// tokens cached in `~/.grok/auth.json`), or the `XAI_API_KEY` env var if they set
/// one. Either way usage bills against the user's own xAI / SuperGrok plan, not an
/// account of Notch's — the whole point of a "use the Grok I already pay for"
/// backend.
///
/// **Compliance posture (mirrors the other CLI backends):** the Grok chat path
/// talks to a private proxy (`cli-chat-proxy.grok.com`) behind an OAuth session,
/// so rather than reimplement and impersonate that handshake we let the official
/// `grok` binary do it — the documented, supported headless interface. Notch
/// speaks no HTTP to xAI, never reads the tokens in `~/.grok/auth.json` (sign-in
/// detection is an existence check on the file's account key, never the token),
/// and only ever executes the genuine binary. Sign-in / re-authorize spawns
/// `grok login`, which opens the user's own browser OAuth flow — the same command
/// they'd run in a terminal (this is why the account row offers it, unlike the
/// Claude row: `grok login` is a first-class user-facing subcommand).
///
/// Shape of the integration (mirrors the twins):
///  · one turn = one `grok` headless process. The persona rides
///    `--system-prompt-override` (Grok's documented `--system-prompt` analog), so
///    the stdin/prompt-file carries only the folded conversation.
///  · `--prompt-file` feeds the folded prompt (no argv-length limit, no stdin
///    merge surprise — a bare `grok -p` also splices piped stdin into the prompt).
///  · `--output-format streaming-json` prints NDJSON: `{"type":"text","data":…}`
///    answer deltas (token-level, so this stream yields as it types), interleaved
///    `{"type":"thought",…}` reasoning we drop, and a terminal `{"type":"end",…}`.
///  · `--tools web_search,web_fetch` leaves exactly the read-only web pair
///    available (the Claude `--tools WebSearch,WebFetch` analog) — no filesystem,
///    no shell — and `--always-approve` lets those run unattended without a TTY
///    approval prompt. `--no-memory` / `--no-subagents` / `--no-plan` keep the
///    turn from touching cross-session memory, spawning helpers, or planning; an
///    ephemeral temp `--cwd` isolates it from the user's project.
///
/// Grok runs its own agent loop (web search, reasoning) internally, so this
/// conforms to `AIService` only — like Codex/Claude it deliberately does NOT adopt
/// the tool harness, so Notch's tools stay out of its way.
